Once you’ve completed the projct each of you should write a brief blog post outlining your project and two
links to the username.github.io/repo-name site and the repo itself (the username may correspond to your
partner). You should then also reflect on the process you went through. Discuss the following:
• what would you do differently?
• what was the most difficult part for you?
• what are your big take-aways from this project?
