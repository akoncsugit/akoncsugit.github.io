title: ST558 First Blog Post: Data Science vs Statistics
---


  I view the role of a data scientist as one that sits at the intersection of statistics/math, computer science, and usually a third area of study. This third field could be anything from biology to sports. I think being a data science requires knowledge of the aforementioned fields to process data, create a model/simulation, and make prediction or provide insight. A data scientist’s role is dynamic and requires creativity in ways traditional research may not.
  Like data scientists, statisticians also process data, create models, and make predictions. I see statisticians work is more math based and heavily tied to the scientific method. To me statisticians are concerned with all stages of a study, from design to analysis, while data scientists primarily focus their efforts after data collection has occurred.
  As my undergraduate degree is in biology, I greatly appreciate a well-designed study and enjoy a more traditional statistical approach. However, I see data science as essential part of many fields and an excellent way to expand my ability to creatively “answer” a multitude of questions. I believe at my core I am a statistician, but as I progress through ST558 that may change.
