### What has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?

My thoughts on the role of a data sciencist have not changed significantly. Previously,
I mentioned that data science is a intersectional field that spans statistics, computer science, and typically a third area of knowledge. My views, in this regard, have not changed. In my initial post, I gave attention to the creativity need to be a data scientist and I belive that still holds true. What I would emphasis is how vital creativity is to the process. To present an end product whether it is an app or simple prediction model, data scientists must actively plan and adapt their approach to meet their goal.

### What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

Prior to this course, I had a preference for R over other statistical languages like SAS, but I lacked an understanding of how to accurately produce summaries and models. I now appreciate the open source nature of R, which I didn't previously understand. I feel as though R is less ridged than SAS and allows for more interesting end results. I will definitely be using R going forward. It is user friendly and it allows for more customizations and flexibility than other statistical packages/languages I have previously used.

### What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

I am going to continute on with the github blog. I think it is helpful to showcase and archive my work or personal projects. I hope to apply what I have learned in this course to create shinyapps, APIs, and other things using public data sets for my own practice. While it is frustrating to sometimes meet deadlines, I actually enjoy the process of coding in R as it allows me to be a tinker. I will definitely write future reports with rmarkdown (when possible). I took this course in hopes xpanding my knowledge of how to use R and I'm leaving this course with a special affinity for R and all it's capabilities.
