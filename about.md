Me at [Linville Falls, NC](https://www.visitnc.com/listing/n9wC/linville-falls)

## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Ashley Ko. I am a graduate student at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). I am currently working on a master’s degree in statistics with an anticipated graduation date of Summer 2022.

### About the blog
This blog was created with the intention of refining my skills as a data scientist. Through this blog, I hope to expand upon my ability to effectively communicate my statistical expertise and analyses as well as challenging myself as a programmer.

### About Me
I live in Durham, North Carolina with my husband and two cats. I grew up in east central Illinois. I traded cornfields for pine trees in 2012 and, while the scenery has changed, my passion for science has not. Originally, this love took the form of biological research in the field of neurodevelopment. It was in this role where I grew to understand the importance of quality experimental design and data analysis. Thus, I was compelled towards a career in statistics.

##### Interests
I am a restless wander and, above everything else, I love travel. I am also an avid runner, hiker, and rock climber. When I am not on the move, I enjoy movies and suspenseful mystery novels.

##### Future Plans
I wish to be a part of a dynamic team working at the intersection of statistics and computer science. I am particularly interested in using my skills to improve the world around me.
More travel would be nice, too! :)
