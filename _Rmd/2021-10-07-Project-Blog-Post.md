\#\#Not my best The vignette process was incredibly instructive. I was
originally interested in the covid data set but had to which do to
repeated errors when accessing the COVID API. I continued with my second
choice, Pokemon and really enjoyed seen how I could apply my new
statistical skills and program ability onto data from one of my
childhood favorite games.

I spent a large part of my time writing out what I was going to do. I
wasn’t sure how to make the data from the API relevant to meet my
summary goals. I was unsure how to designate different endpoints and was
overwhelmed with the possibilities.

Ultimately, this process was great, but I was not. I could blame
preparing for exams or general life woes, but it doesn’t accurately
reflect that I did not start this project in enough time. I have a real
difficulty focusing on assignments and it is an on going problem. So
today is Day 1 to start over. On a more personal note, whether it’s just
the result of being a prolonged global crisis or an undiagnosised
condition, I need to establish a plan that helps me perform at the level
I know I can. I just need to re-examine what that means.
